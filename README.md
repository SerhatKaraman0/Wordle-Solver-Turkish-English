### Wordle spread its fame all over the world. So I code a script to make guessing process easier 

# How-Game-Works
### ðŸŸ© -> Means letter is in word and correct place. Represent with 'g' (green) 
### ðŸŸ¨ -> Means letter is in the word but wrong place. Represent with 'y' (yellow) 
### ðŸŸ¥ -> Means letter not in the word. Represent with 'r' (red)
### 'e' word is to represent word not in wordle database for example if word is not available type 'eeeee' to console
